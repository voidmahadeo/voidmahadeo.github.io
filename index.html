            <h2> About Me </h2> 
            <p> My name is Void Mahadeo, and I am in college. My goal in life is to become a video game developer. 
            I really like playing video games and I think it would be fun to make them as well. Aside from just wanting a well-paying job, 
            I want to be someone who gives back to their community and helps other people. </p>
