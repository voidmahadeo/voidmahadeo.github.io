            <h2> About Me </h2> 
            <p> My goal in life is to become a video game developer. 
            I really like playing video games and I think it would be fun to make them as well. Aside from just wanting a well-paying job, 
            I want to be someone who gives back to their community and helps other people. </p>

            <p>My problem statement is about how the squirrels on USC's campus are used to eating human food, 
            which is not good for them in the long run.</p>
